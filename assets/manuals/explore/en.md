## How to Download Books
When you browse a catalog, if the catalog provides it, each book will display its title, author, cover or thumbnail, summary, publisher, and various link buttons. If the book offers an ebook file in a format supported by NovelGlide, a clickable **"Download"** button will be shown.

After you tap **Download**, a message will confirm that the book has been successfully added to the download queue. You can tap the **"Download"** icon in the top right corner to view your downloads.

Once a book has been successfully downloaded, it will automatically be added to the "All Books" section of your library.
